# Using Bug Detection System with Claude Code

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: June 23, 2025  
**Purpose**: Instructions for using the bug detection system directly with Claude Code

## Overview

This guide shows how to use the dual-mode bug detection system using Claude Code's built-in tools (Read, Grep, Glob, Task) rather than JavaScript execution. Claude Code can analyze your codebase and create bug reports by following these structured workflows.

---

## Single-Agent Workflow for Claude Code

### Step 1: Initialize Bug Detection Session

**Prompt for Claude Code:**
```
I want to run a single-agent bug sweep on my codebase. Please:

1. Read the current bug index at docs/bugs/BUG_INDEX.md to understand existing bugs
2. Use Glob to find all TypeScript/JavaScript files in app/, components/, hooks/, and utils/
3. Analyze the files for the following bug patterns:
   - Authentication loops (useEffect with auth dependencies)
   - Mobile responsiveness issues (fixed widths without @media)
   - Unhandled error cases (fetch/API calls without .catch)
   - Memory leaks (event listeners without cleanup)
   - Security vulnerabilities (dangerouslySetInnerHTML, eval)
   - Performance issues (nested loops, inefficient operations)

4. Create bug reports for any issues found using the existing bug report template
5. Update the main bug index with new findings

Focus on HIGH priority issues first, then work through medium and low priority.
```

### Step 2: Component-Specific Analysis

**For Authentication Issues:**
```
Please analyze authentication-related files for bugs:

1. Use Grep to find files containing "auth", "login", "wallet", "token"
2. Read these files and look for:
   - useEffect hooks that might cause authentication loops
   - Missing error handling in auth flows
   - Wallet connection issues
   - Session management problems

3. Create detailed bug reports for any issues found
4. Add them to docs/bugs/BUG_INDEX.md under the appropriate severity section
```

**For Competition System Issues:**
```
Please analyze competition-related files for bugs:

1. Use Grep to find files containing "competition", "judge", "score", "entry"
2. Look for:
   - Scoring calculation errors
   - Missing validation in judge assignments
   - Entry submission failures
   - Leaderboard inconsistencies

3. Create bug reports and update the index
```

**For Mobile Interface Issues:**
```
Please analyze mobile and UI files for bugs:

1. Use Glob to find .tsx files in components/
2. Look for:
   - Hard-coded pixel values without responsive breakpoints
   - Missing mobile-specific handling
   - Touch interaction issues
   - Navigation problems on mobile

3. Focus on files that likely affect mobile experience
```

## Multi-Agent Simulation Workflow

Since Claude Code can't run multiple agents simultaneously, we simulate multi-agent coordination by having Claude Code work through specialized analysis phases:

### Phase 1: Security & Authentication Analysis

**Prompt:**
```
Act as the AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY SPECIALIST agent. Please:

1. Use Grep to find files with patterns: "auth", "login", "wallet", "session", "token", "password", "security"
2. Read and analyze these files for:
   - Authentication loops and infinite redirects
   - Wallet connection failures  
   - Session management issues
   - Security vulnerabilities (XSS, injection, insecure storage)
   - Permission and access control flaws

3. Create bug reports for issues found, focusing on CRITICAL and HIGH severity
4. Tag reports with "Agent: Authentication Specialist"
```

### Phase 2: Competition System Analysis

**Prompt:**
```
Act as the COMPETITION SYSTEM SPECIALIST agent. Please:

1. Use Grep to find files with patterns: "competition", "judge", "score", "entry", "leaderboard"
2. Analyze for:
   - Scoring calculation errors and edge cases
   - Judge assignment and verification logic
   - Entry submission validation issues
   - Competition state management problems
   - Notification system bugs

3. Create bug reports tagged with "Agent: Competition Specialist"
4. Focus on issues that could affect competition launches
```

### Phase 3: Mobile & UI Analysis

**Prompt:**
```
Act as the MOBILE & UI SPECIALIST agent. Please:

1. Use Glob to find component files: "components/**/*.{tsx,jsx}"
2. Look for:
   - Hard-coded dimensions without responsive design
   - Missing mobile-specific interactions
   - Navigation issues on small screens
   - Touch/swipe gesture problems
   - UI components that break on mobile

3. Create bug reports tagged with "Agent: Mobile Specialist"
4. Include specific mobile device scenarios in reproduction steps
```

### Phase 4: Performance Analysis

**Prompt:**
```
Act as the PERFORMANCE SPECIALIST agent. Please:

1. Use Grep to find performance-related patterns:
   - Nested loops: "for.*for"
   - Inefficient operations: "\.map.*\.map"
   - Missing memoization: "useEffect.*\[\]"
   - Memory leaks: "addEventListener.*removeEventListener"

2. Analyze large components and complex calculations
3. Focus on genetic mapping and data visualization components
4. Create bug reports tagged with "Agent: Performance Specialist"
```

### Phase 5: Integration & API Analysis

**Prompt:**
```
Act as the INTEGRATION SPECIALIST agent. Please:

1. Use Glob to find API routes: "app/api/**/*.ts"
2. Use Grep to find: "fetch", "api", "endpoint", "webhook"
3. Analyze for:
   - Missing error handling in API calls
   - Data consistency issues
   - External service integration problems
   - Database transaction errors
   - Web3/blockchain interaction bugs

4. Create bug reports tagged with "Agent: Integration Specialist"
```
