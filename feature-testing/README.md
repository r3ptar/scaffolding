# Feature Testing System

A comprehensive testing framework for validating Runiverse features during development.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Test a single feature
./test-feature.sh inventory

# Run all feature tests
./run-all-feature-tests.sh

# Test with specific environment
./test-feature.sh combat --env staging

# Generate test report
./test-feature.sh adventure --report
```

## Directory Structure

```
feature-testing/
├── templates/       # Test templates for different feature types
├── runners/         # Test execution scripts
├── reporters/       # Result formatting and reporting
└── examples/        # Example test implementations
```

## Available Test Templates

### API Feature Test
Tests backend endpoints, database operations, and API responses.

### Frontend Feature Test
Tests UI components, user interactions, and state management.

### Integration Feature Test
Tests end-to-end workflows across multiple systems.

### Performance Feature Test
Tests response times, load handling, and resource usage.

## Creating New Feature Tests

1. Choose appropriate template from `templates/`
2. Copy to your feature directory
3. Customize test cases for your feature
4. Run with `test-feature.sh`

## Test Result Format

Tests output structured JSON results that include:
- Feature name and version
- Test execution time
- Pass/fail status for each test case
- Performance metrics
- Error details and stack traces
- Suggestions for fixes

## Integration with Sprint Workflow

These tests integrate with the multi-agent sprint system:
- Agents run tests before marking tasks complete
- Results feed into confidence ratings
- Failed tests automatically create bug reports
- Performance regressions are tracked
