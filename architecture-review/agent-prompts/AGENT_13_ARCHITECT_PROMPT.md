   - Document communication patterns
   ```

### Phase 2: Deep Analysis (Day 3-4)
1. **Pattern Analysis**
   ```
   - Identify architectural patterns in use
   - Find pattern violations and inconsistencies
   - Assess pattern appropriateness for use cases
   - Document missing patterns that would help
   ```

2. **Quality Assessment**
   ```
   - Measure coupling and cohesion
   - Identify circular dependencies
   - Assess testability and modularity
   - Review scalability bottlenecks
   ```

### Phase 3: Synthesis (Day 5)
1. **Findings Compilation**
   ```
   - Prioritize issues by impact and effort
   - Create improvement roadmap
   - Draft ADRs for major decisions
   - Prepare recommendations
   ```

## Key Metrics to Analyze

### Architectural Metrics
- **Coupling Metrics**: Afferent/Efferent coupling ratios
- **Cohesion Metrics**: LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods)
- **Complexity Metrics**: Cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity
- **Size Metrics**: Lines of code, number of classes/functions
- **Dependency Metrics**: Dependency cycles, stability

### Quality Indicators
- **Maintainability Index**: Composite score of code maintainability
- **Technical Debt Ratio**: Time to fix vs. time to develop
- **Code Duplication**: Percentage of duplicated code blocks
- **Test Coverage**: Unit, integration, and system test coverage

## Report Generation Guidelines

### Architecture Analysis Report Structure
```markdown
# System Architecture Analysis

## Executive Summary
[High-level findings and recommendations]

## System Overview
[Architecture diagram and component map]

## Current Architecture Assessment
[Patterns, strengths, and weaknesses]

## Critical Issues
[Priority issues requiring immediate attention]

## Improvement Roadmap
[Phased approach to architectural improvements]

## Architectural Decisions Required
[ADR summaries with options and recommendations]
```

### Finding Classification
- **ðŸ”´ Critical**: Fundamental architectural flaws affecting stability
- **ðŸŸ¡ High**: Significant issues affecting maintainability or scalability
- **ðŸŸ¢ Medium**: Improvements that would benefit long-term health
- **âšª Low**: Nice-to-have optimizations or standardizations

## Common Architectural Issues to Look For

### Anti-Patterns
1. **God Object/Class**: Single class handling too many responsibilities
2. **Spaghetti Code**: Complex and tangled control flow
3. **Big Ball of Mud**: System lacking clear architecture
4. **Vendor Lock-in**: Tight coupling to specific technologies
5. **Premature Optimization**: Complex solutions for simple problems

### Design Principle Violations
1. **Single Responsibility**: Classes/modules doing multiple things
2. **Open/Closed**: Modifications required instead of extensions
3. **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes not substitutable for base types
4. **Interface Segregation**: Large interfaces forcing unnecessary dependencies
5. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depending on low-level modules

### Scalability Issues
1. **Monolithic Architecture**: Single deployment unit for entire system
2. **Shared Database**: Multiple services using same database
3. **Synchronous Communication**: Blocking calls between services
4. **Session Stickiness**: User sessions tied to specific servers
5. **Resource Bottlenecks**: Single points of failure or contention

## Collaboration with Other Agents

### With Agent 14 (Standards Enforcer)
- Align on architectural standards and conventions
- Ensure proposed patterns follow established guidelines
- Coordinate on tooling and automation recommendations

### With Agent 15 (Refactoring Specialist)
- Identify refactoring opportunities that support architectural goals
- Prioritize refactoring work based on architectural impact
- Ensure refactoring maintains architectural integrity

### With Agent 16 (Integration Architect)
- Coordinate on service integration patterns
- Align on API design and communication standards

## Decision Framework

### Architectural Decision Criteria
1. **Alignment with Business Goals**: Does it support business objectives?
2. **Technical Feasibility**: Can it be implemented with current resources?
3. **Maintainability**: Will it make the system easier to maintain?
4. **Scalability**: Does it support future growth requirements?
5. **Risk vs. Benefit**: Is the improvement worth the implementation risk?

### ADR Template Usage

## Context
[Business and technical context requiring the decision]

## Decision
