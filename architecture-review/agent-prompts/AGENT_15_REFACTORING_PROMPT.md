## Analysis Framework

### Code Quality Metrics
```

   ```

## Key Areas to Analyze

### Code Duplication
- **Exact Duplicates**: Identical code blocks across files
- **Near Duplicates**: Similar code with minor variations
- **Structural Duplicates**: Same logic with different variable names
- **Functional Duplicates**: Different implementations of same behavior

### Complexity Hotspots
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Functions with >10 decision points
- **Cognitive Complexity**: Code that's hard to understand
- **Nesting Depth**: Code with >4 levels of nesting
- **Parameter Count**: Functions with >5 parameters

### Performance Issues
- **N+1 Query Problems**: Database queries in loops
- **Inefficient Algorithms**: O(n²) where O(n) possible
- **Memory Leaks**: Objects not properly cleaned up
- **Synchronous Blocking**: Blocking operations on main thread

### Test Quality
- **Coverage Gaps**: Code not covered by tests
- **Test Smells**: Overly complex or brittle tests
- **Missing Edge Cases**: Tests not covering error conditions
- **Flaky Tests**: Tests that fail intermittently

### Opportunity Prioritization Framework
```
Priority = (Impact Score × Confidence) / (Effort × Risk)

Impact Score:
- Performance improvement potential (1-5)
- Maintainability improvement (1-5)
- Bug risk reduction (1-5)
- Developer productivity gain (1-5)

Effort (1-5):
- Development time required
- Testing complexity
- Team coordination needed

Risk (1-5):
- Chance of introducing bugs
- System downtime risk
- Breaking changes impact
```

## Common Code Smells to Identify

### Method-Level Issues
1. **Long Methods**: Functions >50 lines, especially >100 lines
2. **Complex Methods**: High cyclomatic complexity (>10)
3. **Too Many Parameters**: Methods with >5 parameters
4. **Flag Arguments**: Boolean parameters controlling method behavior
5. **Dead Code**: Unreachable code or unused methods

### Class-Level Issues
1. **God Classes**: Classes with >500 lines or >20 methods
2. **Feature Envy**: Methods using other classes more than their own
3. **Data Classes**: Classes that only contain data, no behavior
4. **Refused Bequest**: Subclasses not using inherited methods
5. **Inappropriate Intimacy**: Classes knowing too much about each other

### Design Issues
1. **Shotgun Surgery**: Single changes requiring edits in many places
2. **Divergent Change**: One class changing for multiple reasons
3. **Parallel Inheritance**: Adding a class requires adding to multiple hierarchies
4. **Lazy Class**: Class that doesn't do enough to justify existence
5. **Speculative Generality**: Code designed for future needs that may never come

## Refactoring Techniques Inventory

### Extract Refactorings
```javascript
// Extract Method
function calculateTotal() {
  // Extract this into separate methods
  const subtotal = calculateSubtotal();
  const tax = calculateTax(subtotal);
  const shipping = calculateShipping();
  return subtotal + tax + shipping;
}

// Extract Class
class OrderProcessor {
  // Extract payment logic to PaymentProcessor
  // Extract shipping logic to ShippingCalculator
}
```

### Simplification Refactorings
```javascript
// Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
class Bird {
  getSpeed() {
    switch (this.type) {
      case 'european': return this.getBaseSpeed();
      case 'african': return this.getBaseSpeed() - this.loadFactor;
      case 'norwegian': return this.isNailed ? 0 : this.getBaseSpeed();
    }
  }
}

// After refactoring:
class EuropeanSwallow extends Bird {
  getSpeed() { return this.getBaseSpeed(); }
}
```

### Performance Refactorings
```javascript
// Before: N+1 Query Problem
const orders = await getOrders();
for (const order of orders) {
  order.customer = await getCustomer(order.customerId);
}

// After: Batch Loading
const orders = await getOrders();
const customerIds = orders.map(o => o.customerId);
const customers = await getCustomers(customerIds);
const customerMap = customers.reduce((map, c) => map.set(c.id, c), new Map());
orders.forEach(order => order.customer = customerMap.get(order.customerId));
```

## Testing Strategy for Refactoring

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Existing Tests**: Must pass before and after refactoring
- **Coverage Target**: Aim for >80% coverage of refactored code
- **Edge Cases**: Ensure edge cases are covered
- **Performance Tests**: Before/after performance benchmarks

### Refactoring Safety Practices
1. **Small Steps**: Make small, verifiable changes
2. **Test First**: Ensure tests exist before refactoring
3. **One Thing at a Time**: Don't mix refactoring with feature changes
4. **Automated Testing**: Use CI/CD to catch regressions
5. **Code Reviews**: Have changes reviewed by team members

## Performance Analysis Framework

### Database Performance
```sql
-- Identify N+1 queries
SELECT query, count(*) as frequency
FROM query_log 
WHERE execution_time > 100
GROUP BY query
HAVING count(*) > 50;

-- Find missing indexes
SELECT table_name, column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE column_name LIKE '%_id'
  AND table_name NOT IN (
    SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.statistics
    WHERE column_name LIKE '%_id'
  );
```

### Frontend Performance
```javascript
// Memory leak detection
const memoryUsage = performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory();

// Bundle size analysis
const bundleAnalyzer = require('webpack-bundle-analyzer');

// Runtime performance
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  list.getEntries().forEach((entry) => {
    if (entry.duration > 100) {
      console.warn(`Slow operation: ${entry.name}`);
    }
  });
});
```
