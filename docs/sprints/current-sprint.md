- *Example: "Agent handoffs work well, but need clearer API documentation templates"*

### Coordination Optimizations
- *Add suggestions for better agent coordination*
- *Example: "File ownership matrix prevented all conflicts - keep this!"*

### Reporting Enhancements  
- *Suggest improvements to metrics or tracking*
- *Example: "Need automated test coverage tracking in sprint reports"*

### Tool/Template Changes
- *Suggest changes to templates or tools*
- *Example: "current-sprint.md getting long - consider task limits per sprint"*

### Meta-Learning
