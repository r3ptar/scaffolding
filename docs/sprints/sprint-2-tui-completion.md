### Coordination Optimizations  
- *Testing agent should validate each component as built*
- *Integration testing should happen daily, not end of sprint*

### Reporting Enhancements
- *TUI development needs different metrics - user interaction testing*
- *Need to track terminal compatibility issues*

### Tool/Template Changes
- *May need TUI-specific development workflows*
- *Consider mock data for testing when real files unavailable*

### Meta-Learning
- *TUI development is more complex than standard scripts*
- *Test-driven approach necessary for interactive interfaces*

**Instructions**: This sprint is specifically about learning TUI development best practices. Document everything!

**Sprint Confidence**: 🟡 Medium - TUI development is inherently complex, but achievable with proper testing

## 📝 Pre-Sprint Notes

**Why This Sprint is Needed:**
The Sprint #1 TUI was written too quickly without testing. Real TUI development requires:
- Handling terminal size changes
- Managing curses state properly  
- Error handling for file system issues
- Cross-platform compatibility
- User experience testing

**Sprint #1 Lessons Applied:**
- Don't claim completion without testing
- Complex components need dedicated sprints
- Test-driven development for interactive interfaces
- Integration testing throughout, not just at end

**Expected Challenges:**
- Curses library is notoriously difficult to debug
- Terminal environments vary significantly
- File-based integration more complex than expected
- User experience design for terminal interfaces

This sprint acknowledges the complexity and allocates proper time and agents to build a TUI that actually works reliably. 🎯
